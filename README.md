## About This Project  
This app was created as a **training project** to apply **Flutter concepts**, including **state management, local storage, and UI design**. While my upcoming **university project** will be inspired by **Dubizzle (formerly OLX)**, **Today** focuses entirely on **task management and productivity**.  

I plan to continue improving the app, making it a more **robust and efficient** task management system. üöÄ
