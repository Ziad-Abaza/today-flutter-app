- **Listing items for sale** with descriptions and images
- **Browsing available listings**
- **Search and filter functionality** for easy navigation
- **Basic authentication system**
- **Responsive design** for different screen sizes

## Tech Stack
- **Flutter** (Dart)
- **Provider** for state management
- **SQLite** for local storage
- **Firebase (Planned)** for authentication and backend services
