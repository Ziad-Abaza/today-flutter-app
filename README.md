## About the Project  
This is my **first training project** while learning **Flutter**. It is not related to my upcoming university project, which will be inspired by **Dubizzle (formerly OLX)**.

## Features  
‚úî **Simple and modern UI** for an intuitive user experience  
‚úî **Task management system** to track daily activities  
‚úî **Task categorization and priority levels**  
‚úî **Local storage with SQLite** for offline accessibility  
‚úî **Basic authentication system (Planned)**  
‚úî **Responsive design** for different screen sizes  

## Tech Stack
